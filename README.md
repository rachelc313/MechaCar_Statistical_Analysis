## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Insert screenshot of output

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
    -The following veriables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset:
        - Intercept
        - Vehicle Length
        - Ground_Clearance
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
    - The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-value is less than the standard of 0.05.  
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
    - This linear model seemingly predicts he mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. The r-squared value is 71.49% which is relatively high.
